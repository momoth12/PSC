This is the documentation of [this project](https://github.com/pe712/PSC). It is based of [f1tenth project](https://f1tenth.org/learn.html). The purpose of this repository is to give some python scripts to run the f1tenth car both in simulation and the real racecar.

Note that avoided writting code and documentation specific to our racecar configuration as much as possible. However, there is probably a lot of adaptation if you want to use this repository directly.
