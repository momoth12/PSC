This is the documentation of [this project](https://github.com/pe712/PSC). It is based of [f1tenth project](https://f1tenth.org/learn.html). The purpose of this repository is to give tools to run our source code. This documentation also focuses on some difficulties we encountered.

Note that we avoided writting code and documentation specific to our racecar configuration as much as possible. However, there is probably a lot of adaptation if you want to use this repository in a different lab.
